data collected from simulations run on SciNet system April 15-18 2016.

KCC2 extrusion scaled by volume. 

Cl- diffusion constant changed from 10um^2/ms (as used in single compartment simulations to homogenize Cl across segments) to 2 um^2/ms  (from http://www.nature.com/articles/srep23196; Kuner & Augustine Neuron 2000)
