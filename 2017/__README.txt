KCC2 distributed by surface area from Chris Currin and Joe Raimondo

Ca channels present (L- and T-type) according to Poirazi distribution/conductance values. 

Changed GABA conductance to 530pS (from 53pS from as given in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9214504, then increased by an order of magnitude)

Synaptic densities as follows: 
```
soma = 12.5 / um^2
prox = 0.1334 / um^2
midd = 0.009 / um^2
dist = 0.0025 / um^2
```

For simple cell make syn density 0.025 for prox, middle, distal
4 for soma
